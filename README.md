# Universal Dataspace Interoperability Gateway

### _One gateway. Every dataspace. Trusted everywhere._

> A platform that lets companies in different countries and industries share data securely — without rebuilding their existing systems. Demonstrated through a real-world cross-border vehicle insurance scenario between Europe and Japan.

---

## The Problem

Businesses in Europe and Japan cannot easily share data with each other. Not because they don't want to — but because their digital infrastructure speaks completely different languages:

- **Europe** uses EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector) + Gaia-X trust framework
- **Japan** uses CADDE + JASPAR data standards
- **India** and other regions have their own emerging standards

A Japanese insurer cannot verify a European car's history. A European manufacturer cannot share vehicle data with a Japanese partner without custom-built integrations that cost millions and take months.

> **The result:** Cross-border data sharing is slow, expensive, and full of trust gaps.

---

## The Solution

The **Universal Dataspace Interoperability Gateway** is a **translator and trust bridge** between different dataspace ecosystems.

Think of it like an international airport — planes from every country land, transfer, and depart, without each airline needing to rebuild the entire airport for themselves.

```
┌──────────────┐                                      ┌──────────────┐
│  Europe       │                                      │  Japan        │
│  EDC + Gaia-X │ ◄──── Universal Gateway ────►  │  CADDE        │
│  ODRL + VC    │    (Translate · Trust · Route)       │  JASPAR + VC  │
└──────────────┘                                      └──────────────┘
```

**The gateway does four things:**

| What                     | How                                                                       | Business Value                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Discovers** endpoints  | Resolves digital identity documents (DIDs) to find where data lives       | No phone calls or emails to ask "what's your API URL?" |
| **Translates** protocols | Converts between EDC and CADDE data-sharing protocols                     | No custom integration per partner                      |
| **Transforms** formats   | Converts EU vehicle data (DPP) to Japanese insurance standard (JASPAR)    | No manual data re-entry                                |
| **Enforces** trust       | Verifies every participant's identity and consent before sharing anything | No unauthorized data access                            |

---

## Live Demo: Cross-Border Vehicle Insurance

We demonstrate the complete gateway with one real-world scenario: **a Japanese insurance company wants to underwrite a policy for a European-manufactured car.**

### The People in the Story

| Person / Company    | Role                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TATA Motors**     | European car manufacturer — owns and provides vehicle data          |
| **Digit Insurance** | Japanese insurer — wants to assess the car's risk to price a policy |
| **Mario Sanchez**   | Car owner — must approve any sharing of his vehicle's data          |

### What Happens, Step by Step

```
 Step 1   TATA Motors registers on the platform
          → Gets a verified digital identity (Gaia-X compliance)
          → Gets a data-sharing endpoint (EDC connector)

 Step 2   TATA registers Mario's vehicle
          → Vehicle history published as a Digital Product Passport (DPP)

 Step 3   Mario buys the car
          → Ownership credential issued to his digital wallet

 Step 4   Digit Insurance requests a quote for Mario's car (enters VIN)
          → Platform sends Mario a consent request

 Step 5   Mario approves in his wallet
          → Platform finds TATA's data endpoint automatically (via DID)

 Step 6   Secure 7-step data negotiation between Digit and TATA's systems
          → Contract agreed, data access granted under ODRL policy

 Step 7   Vehicle data fetched from TATA's system
          → Automatically converted from EU format (DPP) to Japanese format (JASPAR)

 Step 8   9-factor risk scoring engine runs
          → Score calculated (0–100 points)

 Step 9   Insurance package recommended with exact premium
          → Policy credential issued to Mario's wallet
```

**Total time: 30–60 seconds, fully automated, zero manual intervention.**

---

## What Makes This Different

### 1. Every Company Gets a Real Digital Identity — Automatically

When a company registers on the platform, it instantly gets a **W3C-standard digital identity** (`did:web`) that:

- Is **publicly resolvable** by any compliant system worldwide
- **Passes Gaia-X compliance** — the EU's trust framework for data spaces
- **Automatically includes its data-sharing endpoint** once its connector is live
- Is **company-specific** — not shared with anyone else

> No manual setup. No IT tickets. No waiting. Register → identity live in seconds.

### 2. Gaia-X Compliance Is Fully Automated

Traditionally, getting Gaia-X compliance requires manual paperwork, IT setup, and weeks of back-and-forth. On this platform:

1. Company fills in a registration form (legal name, VAT ID, address)
2. Platform automatically builds and signs the required credentials **in the company's name**
3. Sends them to the Gaia-X compliance authority (GXDCH)
4. Compliance credential returned — issued directly to the company's own digital identity

> From form submission to Gaia-X verified: minutes, not months.

### 3. Data Endpoints Are Discovered, Not Configured

When Digit Insurance wants TATA's vehicle data, nobody types a URL or calls an IT department. The platform:

1. Reads the car's manufacturer credential
2. Resolves TATA's digital identity document
3. Finds the exact data endpoint listed inside it
4. Connects automatically

> It works like DNS for the internet — but for trusted data sharing.

### 4. Consent Is Non-Negotiable

No data moves without the owner's explicit approval. Mario must:

- Receive a clear description of who is asking, what they want, and why
- Actively approve in his wallet
- All access expires after 1 hour automatically

> Data sovereignty is built into every transaction — not bolted on afterwards.

## Company Onboarding Journey

```
① Register company (name, VAT ID, address, contact)
        ↓
② Platform assigns a unique digital identity:
   did:web:platform-domain:company:your-company-id
        ↓
③ Gaia-X compliance check runs automatically
   (notary verification → SHACL compliance → credential issued)
        ↓
④ Company is now a verified Gaia-X participant
        ↓
⑤ EDC data connector provisioned automatically
        ↓
⑥ Connector endpoint published in company's identity document
   (any partner can now discover and connect — no manual config)
        ↓
⑦ Company is ready to share and receive data across dataspaces
```

## Dynamic Insurance Underwriting Engine

### How Vehicle Data Becomes an Insurance Quote

The platform automatically converts the EU standard vehicle history (Digital Product Passport) into the Japanese insurance format (JASPAR):

| EU Vehicle Data | →   | Japanese Insurance Format |
| --------------- | --- | ------------------------- |
| Mileage (km)    | →   | Odometer reading          |
| Motor type      | →   | Powertrain classification |
| CO₂ emissions   | →   | Sustainability metrics    |
| Damage history  | →   | Risk indicators           |
| Type approval   | →   | Regulatory compliance     |
| Ownership chain | →   | Provenance record         |
| Service history | →   | Maintenance log           |

**24 data fields mapped automatically** with quality tracking — the system tells you exactly how complete the data is and flags any missing critical fields.

### Risk Scoring (100-Point Scale)

| Factor                | Max Score | What It Measures                   |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Vehicle Age           | 15        | Newer = lower risk                 |
| Safety Rating         | 15        | NCAP star rating                   |
| Regulatory Compliance | 10        | Type approval, roadworthiness      |
| Powertrain & Battery  | 10        | EV battery health, motor type      |
| Sustainability        | 5         | Emissions, energy label            |
| Ownership Confidence  | 15        | Single owner, verified credentials |
| Mileage & Usage       | 15        | Lower mileage = lower wear         |
| Damage History        | 10        | Incidents, repairs                 |
| Data Completeness     | 5         | Quality of available data          |

### Insurance Packages by Risk Score

| Score  | Package          | Typical Annual Premium | Coverage Level                             |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 85–100 | **Premium Plus** | €800 – €1,050          | Full comprehensive, zero excess, worldwide |
| 70–84  | **Premium**      | €950 – €1,250          | Full comprehensive, low excess             |
| 55–69  | **Standard**     | €1,150 – €1,550        | Comprehensive, standard excess             |
| 40–54  | **Basic Plus**   | €1,400 – €1,900        | Third-party, fire & theft                  |
| 0–39   | **Basic**        | €1,800 – €2,500        | Third-party only (manual review)           |

EV owners get automatic add-on options: charging cable theft, home charger insurance, battery warranty extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ / npm 10+
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) free account — required so Gaia-X can verify your company's digital identity document

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/jap-eu-hack-2026.git
cd jap-eu-hack-2026
npm install
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — at minimum set the seed-data EDC URLs (TOYOTA_EDC_*,
# TOKIOMARINE_EDC_*) to the FQDNs of your deployed EDC ingresses. The seed
# script will refuse to run without them.

# Bring up the full stack (skip the internal `provisioning` service)
docker compose up -d \
  postgres keycloak \
  waltid-wallet-api waltid-issuer-api waltid-verifier-api \
  backend \
  portal-dataspace portal-tata-admin portal-tata-public \
  portal-wallet portal-insurance portal-company
```

The backend is published on host port **3000** (container internal `:8000`). Portals
read their runtime config from compose env, so changes to `docker-compose.yml`
require a portal recreate (`docker compose up -d <portal>`), not a `restart`.

### Enable Gaia-X Compliance Locally

For Gaia-X to verify company identities, the backend's DID document needs to be
fetchable from a public URL. Run ngrok against the backend's host port:

```bash
# In a separate terminal — note the port is 3000, not 8000:
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the URL shown (e.g. https://abc123.ngrok-free.app) and update backend/.env:
GAIAX_DID_DOMAIN=abc123.ngrok-free.app
APP_BASE_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app

# Recreate the backend so it picks up the new env (restart does NOT re-read env_file):
docker compose up -d backend
```

### Reset / Clean Restart

The seed is idempotent on existing data, but if you want a guaranteed clean slate
(e.g. after editing migrations or seed data) — wipe volumes and recreate:

```bash
# Stop everything and drop the postgres volume
docker compose down -v

# Bring it back up (same command as Quick Start above)
docker compose up -d \
  postgres keycloak \
  waltid-wallet-api waltid-issuer-api waltid-verifier-api \
  backend \
  portal-dataspace portal-tata-admin portal-tata-public \
  portal-wallet portal-insurance portal-company

# Tail backend boot to confirm migrations + seed ran
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Keycloak's H2 database lives inside the container layer (not in a named volume),
so `down -v` does NOT reset Keycloak. If you change `keycloak/realm-export.json`
and need a fresh import:

```bash
docker compose rm -fs keycloak && docker compose up -d keycloak
```

### Toggle Auth

```bash
# In backend/.env: AUTH_ENABLED=true  (or false)
docker compose up -d backend     # NOT `restart` — env_file is only re-read on recreate
docker compose logs backend | grep "auth:"   # confirms ON / OFF
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
docker compose ps                        # service status
docker compose logs -f backend           # tail backend logs
docker compose logs -f portal-dataspace  # tail a portal's nginx logs

# Inspect seeded EDC URLs
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d eu_jap_hack \
  -c 'SELECT "companyId", "managementUrl" FROM edc_provisioning;'
```
